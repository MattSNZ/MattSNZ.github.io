            <p>Studies have shown that even being simply aware of the concept of neuroplasticity can have an effect of the ability of a learner to succeed in the classroom! Knowing that our brains are far more capable than we had previously imagined is great
                for us! We want to be turning neural pathways into neural highways with lots of practice.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m intending to start each day by reviewing the previous days&#39; work and maybe undertaking some simple problems in order to tread in the neurons.</p>

            <p>Neuroplastic change requires 5 components:</p>
            <ul class="actual-list">
                <li>Challenge &amp; novelty</li>
                <li>Intention</li>
                <li>Specific attention</li>
                <li>Repetition &amp; intensity</li>
                <li>Time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Begin by selecting an activity that is new, challenging and important to you. Commit yourself to engaging in the exercise as frequently as you can.</p>
            <p>Even something as simple as brushing your teeth with the opposite hand or buying groceries at a different store can help encourage neuroplastic change!</p>

            <p>A growth mindset is the understanding that our brains are capable of learning and growing for our entire lives. No subject is &quot;too hard&quot;, it just hasn&#39;t been introduced in the right context. This is very relevant to us at EDA,
                because we&#39;re undertaking new learning about web development!</p>

            <p>Not really - I&#39;ve attended a number of personal development courses for work in the past and they all love a good growth mindset session.</p>

            <p>I already do this a lot with my kids! When you get deep into the &quot;why?&quot; questions, eventually you get to a point where you don&#39;t know - I respond by saying &quot;I don&#39;t know yet! Let&#39;s find out!&quot; </p>
            <p>Ensuring that I stay curious will be the most important part of integrating a growth mindset into my journey.</p>
