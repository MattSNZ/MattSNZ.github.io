            <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
            <p>My long-term goal is to build a career as a web developer. After finishing at EDA, my ideal employer is a digital agency of some description. I feel like this will give me a good breadth of experience with different clients in the outside
                world. Ultimately, I'd like to work at a product-led SaaS company.</p>
            <p>I think my interest in learning for knowledge's sake will be really helpful. Even just so far, it's helped me to understand how some technologies work by reading deeper on a subject than just applying what the docs or examples say.</p>
            <p>One of the "soft" skills that I'd most like to get out of my time at EDA is to be able to work effectively in the software development process. I'm also looking forward to working as a team on the same problems - I've mostly worked alone on
                things over the last few years.</p>
            <p>I will manage my workload by blocking out times to focus and minimising distractions. Some of the ways I'll do this will be enabling DND mode on Slack, or even closing it entirely; moving my non-learning internet time to a different browser;
                and leaving my phone in my jacket or bag so I'm not distracted by notifications.</p>
            <p>If I feel myself getting into the weeds, I'll stop entirely and take stock of what's outstanding and where I am in each process. From there I will prioritise according to deadline or importance and work until I've finished the piece of work
                that I'm focussing on. If I still feel like I'm getting too far behind I'll contact my facilitator or a teacher as soon as is feasible to help work out a plan to get things back on track.</p>
            <p>I expect the faciliation team to assist being willing and able to assist and provide experience when it's necessary. I hope that they'll point me in the direction of the answer, rather than just providing it outright.</p>
            <p>I do have some family commitments, which I've blocked into my calendar. Most days I'll need to drop my kids at daycare or school, but I plan (as much as you can with young kids) to still be onsite by 9am for the start of the day. I'll be trying
                to leave early a couple of times a week to pick my youngest up from daycare, but a couple of times a week, as needed, I'll also stay late in order to get projects complete. I have a good setup for working from home after the kids have
                gone to bed on nights when I've had to leave campus early to put my Dad hat on.</p>
