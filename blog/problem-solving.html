            <h3 id="something-i-got-blocked-on">Something I got blocked on</h3>
            <p>
                Recently I got blocked on something that turned out to be a really simple issue. <a href="./javascript-dom.html">A couple of posts ago</a>, we talked about Flow Control - it turns out there are some really important reasons for running
                things in order. For example, you can&#39;t run a JavaScript function on an element that doesn&#39;t exist yet!
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried a whole lot of things. The code itself <em>seemed</em> to be OK. Running the functions in the console worked. Googling the errors didn&#39;t help too much. I even had a facilitator check the code and it looked good to them!
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn&#39;t until I got fed up and went for a sulky walk that my brain wandered of its own accord and I realised what was happening. I&#39;d been trying to attach an event listener to a DOM element before that element had even been created. I moved
                the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element down from the top of the page to the bottom and it worked straight away! <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sometimes</span> Usually your subconscious is smarter than you.

            <h3 id="a-problem-solved-in-an-elegant-way">A problem solved in an elegant way</h3>
            <p>
                The most elegant way to solve problems is usually by deleting code. I recently had a problem where I&#39;d massively overthought the issue and written far more (messy!) code than I needed to. It worked, but it would have been nearly impossible for someone
                to come in and make sense of what I&#39;d done.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realised this, so I took a step back and started doing some research on JS Methods. The problem that I was solving was fairly straightforward so I figured that it must have a simple solution. It turns out I was able to remove about 80% of my spaghetti-code
                and replace it with two methods and some well-defined variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that taking the time to understand the facilities available to us in the language or framework can make your life a whole lot easier than just diving in and writing code!

            <button class="collapsible">Pseudocode</button>
            <div>
                <p>I haven&#39;t spent a lot of time or energy on pseudocode yet - I definitely understand the appeal, but it&#39;s not something that jumps to the front of my mind just yet when writing code.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Trying something</button>
            <div>
                <p>AKA FAFO - This is something that I use a lot. It&#39;s definitely not the most efficient method for problem solving, but sometimes any action feels better than thinking too much about how to solve the problem.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Rubber ducky method</button>
            <div>
                <p>I love the Rubber Ducky Method. I even have a &quot;rubber ducky&quot; on my desk at home. I&#39;ve solved a lot of self-created problems by explaining, step-by-step, how I&#39;m attempting to solve the issue at hand.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Reading error messages</button>
            <div>
                <p>Error messages are great at finding the specific problem that&#39;s stopped things in that moment. They can often obscure the root cause, however.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Console.logging</button>
            <div>
                <p>This is really helpful! Console log all the things!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Googling</button>
            <div>
                <p>Google is my friend. Skipping google and just asking StackOverflow is great too!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Asking your peers for help</button>
            <div>
                <p>Right now I haven&#39;t been asking my classmates for help too much, I&#39;m sure this will change as we get deeper into the bootcamp!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Asking coaches for help</button>
            <div>
                <p>At the moment, when I feel like I&#39;ve exhausted other options or can&#39;t make sense of the google results I&#39;ll ask the coaches. Again, I feel like this will become more common once we&#39;re deeper into bootcamp.</p>
